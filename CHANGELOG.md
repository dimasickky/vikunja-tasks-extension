# Changelog

## [2.0.2] — 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- **`panels.py`** — drop `confirm=` kwarg from the Disconnect `ui.Button`. The parameter was never part of `imperal_sdk.ui.Button` (silently ignored on prod since 2.0.0), and the new V14 validator hard-fails on it. Disconnect now fires immediately on click — same effective behavior as today, just no fake-confirmation string in the props payload. Followup: wire a real `ui.Dialog`-based confirm flow once the frontend Dialog rendering contract has a reference implementation in another extension.

## [2.0.1] — 2026-04-29

### Changed

- **`requirements.txt`** — bump `imperal-sdk==3.0.0` → `==3.4.1`. Pulls in the LLM-FU-1/FU-2 stack (gpt-5 / o-series `max_completion_tokens` rename + `temperature` drop) so chains routed through reasoning models stop falling over to `anthropic/haiku`.
- **`app.py`** — `ChatExtension(model="claude-haiku-4-5-20251001")` removed (deprecated since SDK 3.3.0, hard-error in SDK 4.0). LLM model resolution now flows through kernel ctx-injection (`ctx._llm_configs`). Mirrors the cleanup done in sql-db 1.4.2 and notes 2.5.2.

### Compatibility

- 3.4.0 panel-slot whitelist already met — `panels.py` `slot="left"`, `panels_board.py` and `panels_task.py` `slot="center"`.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-04-27

**Breaking — Bring-Your-Own Vikunja.** Each user now connects their own Vikunja instance via the tasks panel; their data lives in their Vikunja, not in our shared instance. The shared `md-node1` Vikunja becomes an internal/dogfood-only tool. The `the backend service` backend was refactored from a shared-instance broker into a per-user connection manager (encrypted PAT storage + per-call resolve).

### Why

The shared-instance model meant we held tasks data for every user, which is at odds with our positioning ("Webbee speaks to your tools — your data stays with you"). BYO is the federal-grade posture for an integrations-layer product: encrypted PAT at rest in `the backend service`, plaintext in worker RAM only for the single HTTP request that needs it, revokable from the user's own Vikunja UI at any time. It also unblocks the multi-provider future (Linear, Trello, Asana drop into bridge alongside the Vikunja adapter without touching the extension).

### Backend (the backend service v1.0.0, the backend host)

- **New endpoints** — `POST /v1/connect` (login → mint PAT → encrypt → store), `POST /v1/connect/with-pat` (advanced: paste an existing token), `DELETE /v1/connect` (revoke remote + delete local row), `GET /v1/connection` (status, never echoes the PAT).
- **New table** — `vikunja_connections`: `imperal_id` PK + `base_url` + `username` + `vikunja_user_id` (in their instance) + `pat_encrypted` (Fernet ciphertext) + `pat_token_id` (for revoke) + `agency_id` + timestamps. Migration `001_byo_connections.sql`.
- **New module** — `pat.py` (Fernet encrypt/decrypt). Key in `/home/the backend service/.env` as `the encryption key`. Plaintext PAT only ever lives in stack-local handler frames.
- **`vikunja_client.call_as_user`** — per-call: load connection → decrypt PAT → call user's `base_url` with `Authorization: Bearer {pat}`. No more shared-instance JWT minting.
- **Deprecated** — `routes_provision.py` (shared-instance auto-provisioning) is no longer mounted in `app.py`. File kept for 30-day decom window.
- **Bridge bumped 0.4.0 → 1.0.0** to mark the BYO contract.

### Extension (this commit)

- **New** — `handlers_connection.py` with chat functions `connect_vikunja`, `connect_vikunja_with_pat`, `disconnect_vikunja`, `get_connection_status`.
- **`panels.py`** rewritten — connect-first UX: empty/connect/error/connected/broken states. Empty state shows the connect form + "What is Vikunja?" help (vikunja.io self-host link, try.vikunja.io hosted link). Connected state shows smart views + projects + footer with disconnect button.
- **`panels_board.py`, `panels_task.py`, `skeleton.py`** — gracefully handle the bridge's HTTP 412 "no connection" response: render a "Connect your Vikunja in the sidebar" empty state instead of crashing or returning zero counts.
- **`app.py`** — dropped `on_install` (auto-provisioning) and `on_uninstall` (cascade delete). Added `is_no_connection_error(resp)` helper for 412 detection. Added `require_imperal_id(ctx)` fail-loud helper.
- **All handler files (`handlers_crud/_organize/_search/_structure/_collab.py`)** — Russian `ActionResult.error` strings flipped to English (workspace UI policy 2026-04-27). New `_bridge_error_msg(resp, default_prefix)` helper surfaces the bridge's 412 "Connect your Vikunja first" specifically rather than a generic CRUD error.
- **`system_prompt.txt`** rewritten with BYO context — "if no connection, ask user to connect via the panel; never request password in chat".
- **`imperal.json`** — version 2.0.0, top-level tool description mentions BYO, `signals` add `connection.created`/`connection.deleted`.
- **`main.py`** — purge list updated for `handlers_connection`.

### Removed

- Shared-instance auto-provisioning. `imperal_id → vikunja_user_id` mapping (`vikunja_accounts` table) is no longer the routing source. The legacy table stays in the DB schema for the 30-day decom window; new code path doesn't read or write it.
- `on_install` / `on_uninstall` lifecycle hooks. There's nothing to provision (each user connects on demand) and nothing to cascade-delete (their data lives in their Vikunja).

### Operational notes

- **Required env on the backend host** — `the encryption key` in `/home/the backend service/.env`. Generate once via `python3 -c 'from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())'`. Bridge will refuse to start (or the first /v1/connect will fail loudly) without it.
- **Migration** — apply `001_byo_connections.sql` before restarting bridge. Existing `vikunja_accounts` data is left untouched.
- **Bridge restart** is required to pick up the new code. Old code keeps running on shared instance until restart.
- **Existing prod users on shared instance** — there is no automatic data migration. Provide an export tool / amnesty period before decommissioning the shared instance.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-27

SDK migration: `imperal-sdk==2.0.1` → `imperal-sdk==3.0.0` (Identity Contract Unification, W1).

### Why

SDK 3.0.0 deletes `imperal_sdk.auth.user.User`, makes `User`/`UserContext` frozen Pydantic v2 models with `extra="forbid"`, and renames `.id` → `.imperal_id` on user objects. `ctx.user.id` raises `AttributeError` on 3.x with no alias. Production worker venv was upgraded to 3.0.0 — any 2.x-pinned extension breaks on identity reads.

### Changed

- **`app.py`** — `_imperal_id(ctx)` reads `ctx.user.imperal_id` instead of `ctx.user.id`.
- **`requirements.txt`** — `imperal-sdk==2.0.1` → `imperal-sdk==3.0.0`. Equality pin retained as the workspace invariant.

### Not changed

- All other Python source, manifest, system_prompt, panels, handlers — byte-for-byte identical to 1.0.2.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-04-26

Pin bump only: `imperal-sdk==1.6.2` → `imperal-sdk==2.0.1`. Also corrects a pre-existing version drift between `app.py` (which still read `1.0.0`) and `imperal.json` (which read `1.0.1`); both now read `1.0.2`.

### Why

`imperal-sdk` 2.0.1 supersedes the rolled-back 2.0.0 with the v1.6.2 contract restored plus two kernel-internal ICNLI Action Authority hotfixes (`chat/guards.py` destructive `BLOCK` → `ESCALATE`, `core/intent.action_plan.args` JSON-encoded string for OpenAI strict mode). The SDK API surface remains identical to 1.6.2. Per the team's release note: *"v1.6.2 extensions upgrade by pin bump only."*

### Changed

- **`requirements.txt`** — `imperal-sdk==1.6.2` → `imperal-sdk==2.0.1`. Equality pin retained as the workspace invariant.
- **`app.py`** — `Extension("tasks", version="1.0.0")` → `version="1.0.2"`. Brings the runtime-reported version in line with `imperal.json`.

### Not changed

- All extension logic — handlers, panels, system_prompt, manifest tool definitions — identical to 1.0.1.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-04-25

Pin `imperal-sdk==1.6.2` after rolling back the v2.0.0 / SDK v2.0 / Webbee Single Voice rebuild. Code unchanged from 1.0.0; only the SDK constraint moves from a git-URL `v1.5.16` pin to the PyPI `==1.6.2` pin matching the production runtime. The v2.0 work is preserved on the `sdk-v2-migration` branch (and tagged `pre-1.6.2-rebuild-2026-04-25` on main pre-reset).

### Changed

- **`requirements.txt`** — `imperal-sdk @ git+https://github.com/imperalcloud/imperal-sdk.git@v1.5.16` → `imperal-sdk==1.6.2`. Hard PyPI pin is required because PyPI `imperal-sdk==2.0.0` is immutable and resolver picks it without an explicit constraint.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Extension scaffold (main.py, app.py, imperal.json, requirements.txt).
- Bridge HTTP client via `VIKUNJA_BRIDGE_URL` + `VIKUNJA_BRIDGE_KEY` env.
